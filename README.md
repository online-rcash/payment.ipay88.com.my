📌 About DuitJom

DuitJom is designed as a digital platform that brings various customer-facing financial workflows into one centralized web experience.

The platform can be used as a foundation for features such as:

* Customer registration
* Customer authentication
* Payment and repayment information
* Payment status tracking
* Application workflows
* Customer support
* Digital forms
* Notifications
* Payment-related integrations
* Webhook integrations
* Administrative workflows
* News and announcements
* Frequently asked questions
* Terms and policies

The goal of DuitJom is to make financial-related interactions simpler, clearer, and easier to understand from a customer’s perspective.

⸻

✨ Features

🔐 Authentication

DuitJom can support modern authentication workflows designed to provide customers with a convenient way to access the platform.

Possible authentication features include:

* Google Sign-In
* Email authentication
* Phone number authentication
* OTP verification
* Secure session handling
* Login and logout functionality
* Authentication state detection

Authentication implementations should always follow the security requirements of the selected authentication provider.

⸻

💳 Payment & Repayment Interface

The platform can provide a dedicated interface for customers to view payment-related information.

Example information may include:

* Amount payable
* Payment status
* Payment reference
* Due date
* Payment instructions
* Transaction information
* Payment confirmation
* Repayment history

The user interface can be connected to an external payment provider through an appropriate API or payment gateway integration.

DuitJom itself should not be assumed to be a payment processor unless the appropriate licensed infrastructure and regulatory requirements have been fulfilled.

⸻

🔔 Webhook Integration

DuitJom can be designed to work with webhook-enabled services.

A webhook allows an external service to notify DuitJom automatically when an event occurs.

For example:

Customer Payment
       ↓
Payment Provider
       ↓
Webhook
       ↓
DuitJom Backend
       ↓
Update Payment Status
       ↓
Customer Notification

Possible webhook events may include:

* payment.success
* payment.failed
* payment.pending
* payment.refunded
* payment.cancelled
* customer.created
* transaction.updated

Webhook endpoints should be implemented on a secure backend rather than exposed directly through client-side JavaScript.

⸻

🤖 Telegram Integration

DuitJom can also be integrated with Telegram through the Telegram Bot API.

A Telegram bot can be used for operational notifications, customer communication, or internal alerts.

Example workflow:

DuitJom
   ↓
Backend
   ↓
Telegram Bot API
   ↓
Telegram

Possible notifications include:

* New customer registration
* New support request
* Payment notification
* Transaction status
* System notification
* Administrative alert

For Telegram integrations, sensitive credentials such as the Bot Token must never be placed directly inside public frontend JavaScript.

Environment variables or secure server-side configuration should be used instead.

⸻

📱 Responsive Design

DuitJom is designed with responsive web development principles in mind.

The interface can adapt to:

* Mobile phones
* Tablets
* Laptops
* Desktop computers
* Large displays

The design approach prioritizes:

* Clear navigation
* Touch-friendly controls
* Readable typography
* Proper spacing
* Responsive forms
* Mobile-friendly payment interfaces
* Consistent visual hierarchy

⸻

🎨 User Interface

The DuitJom interface follows a modern fintech-inspired design philosophy.

The design can include:

* Modern cards
* Rounded UI components
* Glass-style elements
* Responsive navigation
* Sticky navigation bars
* Sidebar menus
* Loading animations
* Form validation
* Status indicators
* Payment summaries
* Confirmation screens
* Notification components

The interface is intended to remain simple enough for customers who may not be technically experienced.

⸻

📰 News & Information Hub

DuitJom can provide a dedicated information section for displaying important announcements and educational content.

Examples include:

* Platform announcements
* Payment information
* Financial education
* Service updates
* Customer notices
* Frequently asked questions
* System maintenance information

The News Hub can be implemented as a responsive section with cards, sliders, categories, or individual article pages.

⸻

📞 Customer Support

Customer support is an important part of the DuitJom experience.

Possible support channels include:

* Live chat
* Contact forms
* Telegram
* WhatsApp
* Email
* Frequently Asked Questions
* Support ticket systems

A customer support interface can provide predefined categories such as:

* Payment
* Application
* Account
* Technical Support
* Complaint
* Other

⸻

🧾 Customer Forms

DuitJom may use structured forms to collect information required for a specific workflow.

Example fields can include:

* Full Name
* Identification Number
* Phone Number
* Email Address
* Reference Number
* Application ID
* Payment Amount
* Customer Message

Forms should only collect information that is necessary for the intended purpose.

Sensitive personal information should be handled according to applicable privacy and data-protection requirements.

⸻

🔒 Security

Security is a core consideration for any financial-related web application.

DuitJom should follow secure development practices such as:

* HTTPS
* Secure authentication
* Server-side validation
* Input sanitization
* API authentication
* Environment variables
* Secret management
* Webhook signature verification
* Rate limiting
* Access control
* Secure session management
* Protection against common web vulnerabilities

Never expose secrets

The following information should never be committed to a public GitHub repository:

API keys
API secrets
Client secrets
Database passwords
Telegram bot tokens
Payment gateway credentials
OAuth client secrets
Private keys
Authentication tokens

Sensitive configuration should instead be stored using environment variables.

⸻

🌐 Deployment

DuitJom can be deployed using modern web hosting platforms.

Possible deployment environments include:

* GitHub Pages
* Cloudflare Pages
* Netlify
* Vercel
* Traditional web hosting
* Custom VPS
* Cloud infrastructure

Static frontend files can be deployed independently from a backend API.

├── index.html
├── login.html
├── payment.html
├── confirmation.html
├── support.html
├── news.html
│
├── css/

│   ├── privacy-policy.html
│   └── terms-and-conditions.html
│
├── api/
│   └── webhook/
│
├── README.md
└── .gitignore

The actual project structure may differ depending on the deployment architecture.

⸻

⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

Move into the project directory:

cd DuitJom

If the project is a static website, open:

index.html

in a modern web browser.

For backend-enabled implementations, install the required dependencies according to the selected runtime.

⸻

🔧 Configuration

Configuration values should be stored outside publicly accessible frontend code.

Example:

TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=
PAYMENT_API_KEY=
PAYMENT_SECRET=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=

Do not commit actual secret values.

A .env file should normally be excluded using .gitignore.

Example:

.env
.env.local
node_modules/
dist/
build/
*.log

⸻

🔗 API Architecture

DuitJom can communicate with external services through REST APIs.

Example:

Frontend
   ↓
Backend API
   ↓
External Service
   ↓
Response
   ↓
Backend
   ↓
Frontend

The frontend should not directly expose private API credentials.

For example, instead of:

Browser → Private Payment API

use:

Browser → DuitJom Backend → Payment API

This architecture provides better control over authentication, validation, logging, and security.

⸻

💰 Payment Integration

Payment functionality should be implemented through an appropriate payment provider.

A typical payment workflow may look like:

Customer
   ↓
Select Payment
   ↓
DuitJom
   ↓
Payment Provider
   ↓
Customer Completes Payment
   ↓
Payment Provider
   ↓
Webhook
   ↓
DuitJom Backend
   ↓
Payment Status Updated

The exact implementation depends on the selected payment provider and its API documentation.

⸻

🧪 Testing

Before deploying a payment-related system into production, extensive testing should be performed.

Testing should include:

Authentication

* Successful login
* Failed login
* Logout
* Invalid authentication state
* Session expiration

Forms

* Required fields
* Invalid phone numbers
* Invalid email addresses
* Invalid identification numbers
* Empty fields
* Unexpected input

Payments

* Successful payment
* Failed payment
* Pending payment
* Cancelled payment
* Duplicate transaction
* Refund
* Invalid callback

Webhooks

* Valid webhook
* Invalid webhook
* Duplicate webhook
* Missing fields

⸻

🚨 Error Handling

The application should provide clear error messages without exposing sensitive technical information.

Instead of displaying:

Database connection failed at 192.168.x.x

the application should display something like:

Unable to process your request at this time.
Please try again later.

Detailed errors should be recorded securely on the server for debugging.

⸻

📝 Logging

Production systems should maintain appropriate logs for:

* Authentication events
* API requests
* Payment events
* Webhook events
* System errors
* Administrative actions

Logs should not contain unnecessary sensitive information such as:

* Passwords
* OTP codes
* API secrets
* Full authentication tokens
* Payment credentials

⸻

🔐 Privacy

DuitJom may process information submitted through its website depending on the features implemented.

Users should be informed about:

* What information is collected
* Why information is collected
* How information is used
* How information is stored
* How long information is retained
* Who may receive the information
* How users can request appropriate data-related actions

A dedicated Privacy Policy should be provided before collecting personal information in production.

⸻

      ┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
      │   Payment   │      │  Database   │      │ Telegram    │
      │   Provider  │      │             │      │    Bot      │
      └──────┬──────┘      └─────────────┘      └─────────────┘
